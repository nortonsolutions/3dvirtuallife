###Controls:
*mouse movement* - visual field
*scroll wheel* - adjust zoom

*left/right mouse buttons*
Talk with friendlies /
Use or activate the selected object (like switches)

*Only when in attack range*
left/right attack (hold shift for kick attacks if the model supports)

*middle mouse button* - launch/throw/toss item equipped in hand
(e.g. planting sunseeds, watering from watercan, or firing arrows with bow equipped)

*arrow keys* - movement
*space bar* - jump
*i* - inventory (use the toggle to view spells; both allow multiple pages)
*h* - hotkey sidebar (shows the items/spells that have been equipped to hotkeys)
*1-8* - hotkeys; use the item/spell for each mapped key
*m* - mini-map
*alt-t* - toggle chat

When you're on the inventory screen, drop an item by dragging it to the red square.  This is also how you place a house.

##Things to beginners to try:

* Talk and trade with friendlies
* Attack beasts at close range (or launch arrows)
* Pick up the key and open the hatch to the dungeon
* Go rafting on the lake by mounting the fishing boat
* Gain enough money to buy the fishing pole and go fishing at the lake
* Take the elevator up and see the sights by mounting the hot-air balloon
* Plant a sunseed, fill the watering can at a water source, and water the seed
* Use sunfruit or animal meat to feed a horse and gain his loyalty for a while
* If you find some ore on the ground, it's probably a good place to mine for more...
* Can you find the swamp or the lava field?  How about the kingdom or snowy land?
* Buy a house from the elfgirl in the outer kingdom and place it wherever you want, with a personalized key
* Help the vikings to defend their land and learn the passphrase to enter the inner kingdom

This is still just a demo and may never finish entirely.  I'm putting this on ice for a while!  It was a good learning experience, challenging and fun.

This production version assumes MongoDB is up and running on port 27017 and uses the DB called "nortonAdventure" (wiredtiger) by default.  the mongodb+srv format will work as well in your .env.  Sample configuration:

```bash
PORT=3001
DB=mongodb+srv://norton:GyGUjtrkt.mongodb.net/3dvirtuallife?retryWrites=true&w=majority
NODE_ENV=development
PRE_WELCOME_MESSAGE=–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç!
WELCOME_MESSAGE=Welcome to my ü™ônline game!
WELCOME_SUBTITLE=–≠–ø–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ 3D-–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∂–¥–µ—Ç –≤–∞—Å!
```

Unzip cdn.zip, png.zip, and 3d.zip in their respective directories for stock libraries/graphics.
You may need to rename some graphics to lowercase the extensions, etc.  I'm too lazy to go re-zip
this massive file or change the references.  I was running on Windows before (case-insensitive)
and found I had to do some mass-renaming on Ubuntu.  Just watch F12/devtools in the browser to
see which files are causing trouble.  Here's a quick way to mass-lowercase the extensions:

```
find . -name '*.*' -exec sh -c '
  a=$(echo "$0" | sed -r "s/([^.]*)\$/\L\1/");
  [ "$a" != "$0" ] && mv "$0" "$a" ' {} \;
```

Also change the references to localhost to your own public IP address for socket handling
(unless you only want to play locally).

Thanks to the graphics team: Mike Tidwell, Chris Lobato, Rodney Thinn, and Steve Leavitt.

# Only applicable for auto-startup with pm2:

To configure auto-startup for pm2.exe service with pm2-windows-service module:

Launch Git Bash in Administrative Mode, then run the following:

```
[ /c/util/courseApp/utils/yarn-pm2-windows-service/node_modules/pm2-windows-service ]

$ bin/pm2-service-install -n pm2
? Perform environment setup (recommended)? Y
? Set PM2_HOME? Y
? PM2_HOME value: c:\3Dvirtualife\utils\node
? Set PM2_SERVICE_SCRIPTS (the list of start-up scripts for pm2)? N
? Set PM2_SERVICE_PM2_DIR (the location of the global pm2 to use with the service? Y
? Specify the directory containing the pm2 version to be used by the service:
C:\util\courseApp\utils\node\node_modules\pm2
```

PM2 service installed and started.

Then again in administrative mode,

```
$ sc \\DESKTOP-83JAE79 config pm2.exe depend= MongoDB
```

To check pm2 services, login to cmd or bash in Administrative mode.

```
$ cd <project root>
$ pm2 start ./runner.sh --name 3DvirtualLife
$ pm2 save
```

(The 'pm2 save' will cause pm2 to pick up from where it leaves off on the next restart.)

---

Manual startup of the production server (pm2 only):

Assuming the MongoDB process is running, start 3D Virtual Life with:

```
pm2 start 3Dvirtuallife
```

Logs are in utils/node/logs

---

Manual startup of the production server (standard node):

```
node server.js
```

---

---

Development mode (only if you have the /utils directory):

If you want to run in development mode with a standalone DB (mmapv1),
you can startup a local MongoDB using 'startDB.bat' instead (port 27018).
Use F5 in Visual Studio Code to launch with .env settings.

Express-Session Warning: connect.session() MemoryStore
is not designed for a production environment, as it will leak memory,
and will not scale past a single process.
